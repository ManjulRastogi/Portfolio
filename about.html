            Welcome to my portfolio!
            I'm Manjul, a dedicated individual with a passion for problem-solving and community engagement. With a background as a Core Committee member at Kavyanjali Club, I've honed my organizational skills by orchestrating various events and initiatives.
            On the digital front, I've tackled over 300 problems on Codechef using C++, showcasing my analytical prowess and love for coding. I'm also adept at HTML and JavaScript, with a keen interest in web development.
            You'll find a glimpse of my project portfolio on my GitHub profile, where I demonstrate my ability to learn new skills and manage projects effectively.
            With a commitment to continuous learning and a drive to make an impact, I'm excited to embark on new challenges and opportunities in the world of technology.
